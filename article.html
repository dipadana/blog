        10 Things I Would Have Liked To Know When I Started Working as a
        Software Engineer
      </p>
      <p class="article-detail-content">
        When you’re a first time developer, everything is exciting and scary at
        the same time. You look at your Senior Software Engineering counterparts
        and wonder if you’ll ever make it to that level. It takes a few years to
        understand the ins-and-outs of the business, but once you’re there you
        realize how hard on yourself you actually were.
        <br /><br />
        1. You Can’t Learn Everything <br />
        You don’t know what you don’t know. It seems like you can just keep
        studying and you’ll know everything there is to know eventually. After a
        few years of a grueling work and study routine, you’ll finally realize
        that you now have accumulated 0.001% of the knowledge in programming.
        Instead of trying to memorizing everything, your learning-pattern will
        switch to learning the concepts; everything else can just be looked up.
        <br /><br />
        2. The Imposter Syndrome is Real <br />
        Everyone seems to be killing it. How in the world did you land this
        position? Guess what? Everyone else is thinking the same thing. There
        are a rare few exceptions. These are the individuals that get into a
        framework and optimize it to the point that the framework creators are
        calling them and asking for assistance. However, 99% of developers in
        the same position as you will feel like they were hired and they didn’t
        deserve it.
        <br /><br />
        3. Work Politics Are There. Get Used to Them.<br />
        You may not realize it yet, but you have to change the way you interact
        with the various different individuals within the organization. The
        amount of times I’ve heard “we don’t want to step on anyone’s toes” is
        countless. You’ll realize that some individuals are jealous of where
        you’re at; others will sabotage your career if you rub them the wrong
        way. Some are extremely protective of their title and will put you in
        place if you challenge it in any way. Learn who’s sensitive to what and
        know when to speak up and when to keep quiet. This is probably the
        single best way to advance your career.
        <br /><br />
        4. Management Is Frequently Unqualified You <br />
        look up to your boss. This is where you want to be one day. If you keep
        learning the concepts you’ll get that type of job eventually. You start
        to notice that every time you speak to them, their responses are
        extremely shallow in depth. They answer questions from a 10,000 foot
        level. You brush it off since it seems like they know what they’re
        talking about. After a while, you realize that they barely know
        anything. How did they get this position with the extremely limited
        knowledge? Sometimes management doesn’t need to have the depth that you
        think they should have. More frequently than not, it’s who you know and
        not what you know.
        <br /><br />
        5. It’s Better to Change Jobs Than Wait for a Raise <br />
        After a year of proving yourself, it’s time for a raise. A performance
        review is given and you receive your raise: a measly 3.1%. You know that
        you deserve more. What happened? Do they think you’ll work for this wage
        forever and just provide you with a 3.1% raise each year? It hardly
        seems fair. Behind the scenes, it’s a little more complicated. Your
        title has a salary range that was defined. In order for you to make more
        money, you have to change titles. There’s also a yearly budget
        discussion. This year it was discussed that each employee can get up to
        a 3.1% cost-of-living raise based on performance. If your boss gives you
        more, they have to take a few percentage points away from someone else.
        It’s just easier to blanket give everyone their 3.1% and move on. When
        you move to a different company, you can negotiate a much higher salary.
        I’ve seen developers change jobs yearly since they can get a 15–20%
        raise each time that they move. Makes more sense than working for 3.1%
        more.
